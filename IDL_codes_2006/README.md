IDL codes that read the files output by the c code (perhaps called CYLBIN.c or CYLBIN3.c or given a longer name), 

The code performs the Doppler dealiasing, and computations (fallspeed corrections, etc. etc. etc.), 

The code also generates lots of plots, perhaps based on verbosity level flags set in the .idl parameters file.
